I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Labs 8, 9, and 10 were my favorites. Each of these labs were centered around concepts that are integral to the coding experience. While I could tell that from the reading that they were important concepts, I really enjoyed getting to play around with the tools that we had read about in the reading and lectures and apply them to a real application. 

Figuring out how to apply each one took time, patience, and research. Each one had difficulties that required meticulous inspection, and pushed me to write out my thoughts or seek online resources to figure out the cause of my frustration.

The specific tools I found to be interesting are:
* command line arguments
* loops, nested loops
* 2D vectors
* read/write files, I/O stream
